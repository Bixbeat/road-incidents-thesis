# Detecting Physical Incidents from Street-Level Imagery
Code accompanying my MSc thesis in road incident detection from street-level imagery and its subsequent publication.

##  Introduction
The current state of the literature on self-driving vehicles primarily concerns itself with detecting traffic signs, pedestrians, and imminent crashes. However, self-driving vehicles do not yet distinguish between a normally functioning road network and a disturbed road network. This research concerns a first inquiry on whether or not vehicles may be able to detect incidents. As a follow-up, vehicles may be equipped with algorithms to detect incidents so that they can send a signal to a central map so that all other vehicles can become aware that there is an incident in that location.

## Data
In total, over 12,500 positive examples of incidents have been collected. The images are available **for non commercial use** in the following Google Drive link:

## Pre-trained model
We supply the parameters of the pre-trained ResNet-34 model in the following Google Drive link:

The supplied Pickle file contains both the runtime results and the pre-trained model parameters.
