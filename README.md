Code accompanying my MSc thesis  in road incident detection from street-level imagery.

The current state of the literature on self-driving vehicles primarily concerns itself with detecting traffic signs, pedestrians, and imminent crashes. However, self-driving vehicles do not yet distinguish between a normally functioning road network and a disturbed road network. This research concerns a first inquiry on whether or not vehicles may be able to detect incidents. As a follow-up, vehicles may be equipped with algorithms to detect incidents so that they can send a signal to a central map so that all other vehicles can become aware that there is an incident in that location.

## Phases
This research spans three fases, namely:
1. API connections for image gathering âœ“
2. Querying & data collection
3. Classification using PyTorch
